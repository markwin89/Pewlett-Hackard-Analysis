## Overview

### Purpose
Linking tables to create a table with the list of employees that are retiring soon.  Also, to portray which titles and the departments are in that soon to be retired table. This list would be used to create an initiative for a mentorship program. 

---
## Results
### Retiring Titles
- A large amount of Senoir Engineers and Senior Staff is retiring within the next 3 years.  
  - The next titles are engineers, and staff.

## Summary

- The total count for retirement within the 3 year parameter (1952-1955) is 53977.  
- Department retirement count

  - We should focus on replacing roles in Development, Production, and Sales.  

### Mentorship
- There is a huge gap of those who are retiring and the current employees that are eligible to be in the mentorship.  
  - Retiring total: 53977
  - Mentorship total: 1549  
  - ![Retiring Current Count](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101272613/166967703-96ac97fd-1cf8-4ccd-8071-f9ce987f8054.png)
    - I suggest to broaden the years parameter for Mentorship eligibility or hiring younger candidates. 
    - While running the tables, there are no employees that were born after 1965.
